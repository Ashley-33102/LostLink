## 📂 Project Status

> This project was built as part of my self-learning journey. As a beginner in TypeScript, React, and Express, I used AI-assisted tools like ChatGPT and Replit’s agent to guide me through the development process. Every feature was tested, debugged, and customized by me with a deep focus on learning.
